# MolSSI_App
Code to show MolSSI for the 2024 Software competition  

This is a somewhat curated repository of a few things I've done in the Noid lab
Admittedly, I would describe it as a collection of python and bashed scripts along with some seperately compiled executables for BOCS
Since the "Software" portion of my development efforts has included customized functions for the unreleased version of BOCS (v5, in progress)
and thus to avoid an unintentional pre-release of this project I have ablated code that is not ready for release and unnecessary for each function when directions are followed
I have also seperated folders with code written by me vs. the BOCS heirloom files I maintain / make use of, which were primarily written by prior Noid group members

List of Repository items: 
     
     -some simple python scripts I've put together for prior research projects [Research_Scripts]
     
     -The python scripts required to recreate the figure included in the written proposal of the application [Figure_1]
     
     -Additional BOCS functions I've written given the above disclaimer [MBOCS_Functions]
     
     -The beginings of a bash-based automated test suite I am in the midst of designing for BOCS [BOCS_AUTO_TEST]
