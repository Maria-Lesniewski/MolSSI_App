# MolSSI_App
Code to show MolSSI without granting access to in progress lab repos

This is a somewhat curated repository of my efforts in the Noid lab for the 2024 Software competition.
Admittedly, I would describe it as a collection
The "Software" portion of my development efforts has included customized functions for the unreleased version of BOCS [v5, in progress]
and thus to avoid an unintentional pre-release of this project I have ablated all code unnecessary to each function and seperated files
written exclusively by me from heirloom files I've altered or worked to understand

It contains: 
     -some simple python scripts I've put together for prior research projects [Research_Scripts]
     
     -The python scripts required to recreate the figure included in the written proposal of the application [Figure_1]
     
     -Additional BOCS functions I've written given the above disclaimer [MBOCS_Functions]
     
     -The beginings of a bash-based automated test suite I am in the midst of designing for BOCS [BOCS_AUTO_TEST]
