Welcome to par builder 

To use simply call: 
../build/bin/make_par -f AA_Dioxane.btp -o par.txt

This will generate the list of interactions required for a CG model based on the topology passed
[Considers Intramolecular Exclusions when generating required nb list, [e.g. if there's only one instance of a molecule type]]

Note that the resultant par.txt file will not include the temperature of your simulation or the input and .btp file you'd like to use when force-matching
Please fill those entries yourself


In the event that the default BOCS settings are not desirable for force-matching, please use the edit bash script to change basis functions/bins
[an example using sed to change the settings is shown]
