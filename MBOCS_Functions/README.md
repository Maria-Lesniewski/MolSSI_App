Contains cmake files and partial BOCS_v5 src code for 2 functions:

1) make_par, an executable I am working on for BOCS_v5 to generate the par.txt file required for forcematching in BOCS based on CG topology info from bocs .btp file [files included to try]

2) orientation_checker, an executable I wrote as a one off to determine dot products between atomistic_dioxane orientation as a function of the CG center of mass pair distribution
